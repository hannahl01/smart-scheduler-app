# Smart Scheduler

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quickstart

Click [here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ltquiambao/smart-scheduler-app) to open a gitpod instance.
It should automatically run and show a prompt to open port 3000 in preview or browser.

If not run automatically, you can always run it using `npm install` then `npm run start`
wait for a prompt asking you to open port 3000 in preview or browser.
